# Markdown Extra Parser Class

# Note: Currently the implementation resides in the temporary class
# \Michelf\MarkdownExtra_TmpImpl (in the same file as \Michelf\Markdown).
# This makes it easier to propagate the changes between the three different
# packaging styles of PHP Markdown. Once this issue is resolved, the
# _MarkdownExtra_TmpImpl will disappear and this one will contain the code.

	### Parser Implementation ###

	# Temporarily, the implemenation is in the _MarkdownExtra_TmpImpl class.
	# See note above.
